# Online Virtual Library

# Stancu Gabriel-Marius

I created this web app as a simulation of an online library,
using Laravel as the framework and MySQL databases.
A user needs to create his own profile to access the books
from the library (simulated in a database). You can borrow
a maximum of 3 books at a time, and you also need to return
them. You can borrow only available books. The books that are
used by someone else at that time cannot be borrowed. There
is also a comment section at each book where the users can
write their thoughts on a book. If they are not satisfied
with what they just wrote, they can delete the comment at any
time. If a user is not logged in, there is no way he can search 
for books.
